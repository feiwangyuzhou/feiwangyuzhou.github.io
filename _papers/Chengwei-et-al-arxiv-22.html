abstract: 'Existing approaches to lifelong language learning rely on plenty of labeled
  data for learning a new task, which is hard to obtain in most real scenarios. Considering
  that humans can continually learn new tasks from a handful of examples, we expect
  the models also to be able to generalize well on new few-shot tasks without forgetting
  the previous ones. In this work, we define this more challenging yet practical problem
  as Lifelong Few-shot Language Learning (LFLL) and propose a unified framework for
  it based on prompt tuning of T5. Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage
  of PT''s strong few-shot learning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as
  a task solver and a data generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task
  type, LFPT5 generates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and
  later gets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge
  as it learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to achieve
  label consistency between the previous and the current model. While adapting to
  a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt embeddings for the new
  task. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LFPT5 can be applied to various
  different types of tasks and significantly outperform previous methods in different
  LFLL settings.
