abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce a new parallel corpus of subtitles of educational
  videos: the AMARA corpus for online educational content. We crawl a multilingual
  collection community generated subtitles, and present the results of processing
  the Arabic–English portion of the data, which yields a parallel corpus of about
  2.6M Arabic and 3.9M English words. We explore different approaches to align the
  segments, and extrinsically evaluate the resulting parallel corpus on the standard
  TED-talks tst-2010. We observe that the data can be successfully used for this task,
  and also observe an absolute improvement of 1.6 BLEU when it is used in combination
  with TED data. Finally, we analyze some of the specific challenges when translating
  the educational content.
