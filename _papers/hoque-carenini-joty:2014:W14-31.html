abstract: 'Exploring an online conversation can be very difficult for a user, especially
  when it becomes a long complex thread. We follow a human-centered design approach
  to tightly integrate text mining methods with interactive visualization techniques
  to support the users in fulfilling their information needs. The resulting visual
  text analytic system provides multifaceted exploration of asynchronous conversations.
  We discuss a number of open challenges and possible directions for further improvement
  including the integration of interactive human feedback in the text mining loop,
  applying more advanced text analysis methods with visualization techniques, and
  evaluating the system with real users.
