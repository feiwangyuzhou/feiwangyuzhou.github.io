  \ in community Question Answering. Following the state of the art, we approach the\
  \ task with a global inference process to exploit the information of all comments\
  \ in the answer-thread in the form of a fully connected graph. Our contribution\
  \ comprises two novel joint learning models that are on-line and integrate inference\
  \ within learning. The first one jointly learns two node- and edge-level MaxEnt\
  \ classifiers with stochastic gradient descent and integrates the inference step\
  \ with loopy belief propagation. The second model is an instance of fully connected\
  \ pairwise CRFs (FCCRF). The FCCRF model significantly outperforms all other approaches\
  \ and yields the best results on the task to date. Crucial elements for its success\
  \ are the global normalization and an Ising-like edge potential.}},\n series = {NAACL'16},\n\
