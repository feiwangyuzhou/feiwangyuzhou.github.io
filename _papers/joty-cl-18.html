abstract: 'We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network
  that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures
  long range entity transitions  along with entity-specific features without loosing
  generalization, thanks to the power of  distributed representation. We present a
  pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and
  learn task-specific high level features. We further extend our approach to model
  discourse coherence in asynchronous conversation (e.g., forum, email) by incorporating
  the conversational structure into the grid representation. Our evaluation on the
  standard coherence assessment tasks in monologue demonstrates that our model achieves
  state of the art results outperforming existing models by a good margin. The evaluation
  on a forum dataset shows the benefit of modeling conversational structure. A further
  evaluation demonstrates the utility of our neural coherence model for the task of
  thread reconstruction in forum conversation.
