abstract: 'Structured representations of images according to visual relationships
  are beneficial for many vision and vision-language applications. However, current
  human-annotated visual relationship datasets suffer from the long-tailed predicate
  distribution problem which limits the potentials of visual relationship models.
  In this work, we introduce a self-supervised method that implicitly learns the visual
  relationships without relying on any ground-truth visual relationship annotations.
  Our method relies on 1) intra- and inter-modality encodings to respectively model
  relationships within each modality separately and jointly, and 2) relationship probing,
  which seeks to discover the graph structure within each modality. By leveraging
  masked language modeling, contrastive learning, and dependency tree distances for
  self-supervision, our method can learn better object features as well as implicit
  visual relationships. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on various
  vision-language tasks that benefit from improved visual relationship understanding.
