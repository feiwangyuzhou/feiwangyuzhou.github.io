abstract: 'We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network
  that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures
  long range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without loosing
  generalization, thanks to the power of distributed representation. We present a
  pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and
  learn task-specific high level features. Our evaluation on three different coherence
  assessment tasks demonstrates that our model achieves state of the art results outperforming
  existing models by a good margin.
