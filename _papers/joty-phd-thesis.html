abstract: 'A well-written text is not merely a sequence of independent and isolated
  sentences, but instead a sequence of structured and related sentences. It addresses
  a particular topic, often covering multiple subtopics, and is organized in a coherent
  way that enables the reader to process the information. Discourse analysis seeks
  to uncover such underlying structures, which can support many applications including
  text summarization and information extraction. This thesis focuses on building novel
  computational models of different dis- course analysis tasks in asynchronous conversations;
  i.e., conversations where par- ticipants communicate with each other at different
  times (e.g., emails, blogs). Ef- fective processing of these conversations can be
  of great strategic value for both organizations and individuals. We propose novel
  computational models for topic segmentation and labeling, rhetorical parsing and
  dialog act recognition in asyn- chronous conversation. Our approaches rely on two
  related computational method- ologies: graph theory and probabilistic graphical
  models. The topic segmentation and labeling models find the high-level discourse
  struc- ture; i.e., the global topical structure of an asynchronous conversation.
  Our graph- based approach extends state-of-the-art methods by integrating a fine-grained
  con- versational structure with other conversational features. On the other hand,
  the rhetorical parser captures the coherence structure, a finer discourse structure,
  by identifying coherence relations between the discourse units within each comment
  of the conversation. Our parser applies an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities
  inferred from a discriminative graphical model which allows us to represent the
  structure and the label of a discourse tree constituent jointly, and to capture
  the sequential and hierarchical dependencies between the constituents. Finally,
  the dialog act model allows us to uncover the underlying dialog struc- ture of the
  conversation. We present unsupervised probabilistic graphical models that capture
  the sequential dependencies between the acts, and show how these models can be trained
  more effectively based on the fine-grained conversational structure. Together, these
  structures provide a deep understanding of an asynchronous conversation that can
  be exploited in the above-mentioned applications. For each discourse processing
  task, we evaluate our approach on different datasets, and show that our models consistently
  outperform the state-of-the-art by a wide margin. Of- ten our results are highly
  correlated with human annotations.
