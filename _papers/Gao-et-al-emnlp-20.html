abstract: 'Document interpretation and dialog understanding are the two major challenges
  for conversational machine reading. In this work, we propose DISCERN, a discourse-aware
  entailment reasoning network to strengthen the connection and enhance the understanding
  for both document and dialog. Specifically, we split the document into clause-like
  elementary discourse units (EDU) using a pre-trained discourse segmentation model,
  and we train our model in a weakly-supervised manner to predict whether each EDU
  is entailed by the user feedback in a conversation. Based on the learned EDU and
  entailment representations, we either reply to the user our final decision “yes/no/irrelevant”
  of the initial question, or generate a follow-up question to inquiry more information.
  Our experiments on the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out test set) show that DISCERN
  achieves state-of-the-art results of 78.3% macro-averaged accuracy on decision making
  and 64.0 BLEU1 on follow-up question generation.
