abstract: 'We present a framework for the analysis of Machine Translation performance.
  We use multivariate linear models to determine the impact of a wide range of features
  on translation performance. Our assumption is that variables that most contribute
  to predict translation performance are the key to understand the differences between
  good and bad translations. During training, we learn the regression parameters that
  better predict translation quality using a wide range of input features based on
  the translation model and the first-best translation hypotheses. We use a linear
  regression with regularization. Our results indicate that with regularized linear
  regression, we can achieve higher levels of correlation between our predicted values
  and the actual values of the quality metrics. Our analysis shows that the performance
  for in-domain data is largely dependent on the characteristics of the translation
  model. On the other hand, out-of domain data can benefit from better reordering
  strategies.
