abstract: 'Popular Neural Machine Translation model training uses strategies like
  backtranslation to improve BLEU scores, requiring large amounts of additional data
  and training. We introduce a class of conditional generative-discriminative hybrid
  losses that we use to finetune a trained machine translation model. Through a combination
  of targeted finetuning objectives and intuitive re-use of the training data the
  model has failed to adequately learn from, we improve the model performance of both
  a sentence-level and a simple contextual model without using any additional data.
  We target the improvement of pronoun translations through our finetuning and evaluate
  our models on a pronoun benchmark testset. Our sentence-level model shows a 0.5
  BLEU improvement on both the WMT14 and the IWSLT13 De-En testsets, while our simple
  contextual model achieves the best results, improving from 31.81 to 32 BLEU on WMT14
  De-En testset, and from 32.10 to 33.13 on the IWSLT13 De-En testset, with corresponding
  improvements in pronoun translation.
