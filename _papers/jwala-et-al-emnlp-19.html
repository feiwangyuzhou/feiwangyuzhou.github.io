abstract: 'The ongoing neural revolution in machine translation has made it easier
  to model larger contexts beyond the sentence-level, which can potentially help resolve
  some discourse-level ambiguities such as pronominal anaphora, thus enabling better
  translations. Unfortunately, even when the resulting improvements are seen as substantial
  by humans, they remain virtually unnoticed by traditional automatic evaluation measures
  like BLEU, as only a few words end up being affected. Thus, specialized evaluation
  measures are needed. With this aim in mind, we contribute an extensive, targeted
  dataset that can be used as a test suite for pronoun translation, covering multiple
  source languages and different pronoun errors drawn from real system translations,
  for English. We further propose an evaluation measure to differentiate good and
  bad pronoun translations. We also conduct a user study to report correlations with
  human judgments.
