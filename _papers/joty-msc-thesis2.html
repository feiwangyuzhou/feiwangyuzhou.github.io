abstract: 'When a user is served with a ranked list of relevant documents by the standard
  docu- ment search engines, his search task is usually not over. He has to go through
  the entire document contents to find the precise piece of information he was looking
  for. Question answering, which is the retrieving of answers to natural language
  questions from a doc- ument collection, tries to remove the onus on the end-user
  by providing direct access to relevant information. This thesis is concerned with
  open-domain question answering. We have considered both simple and complex questions.
  Simple questions (i.e. factoid and list) are easier to answer than questions that
  have complex information needs and require inferencing and synthesizing information
  from multiple documents. Our question answering system for simple questions is based
  on question classification and document tagging. Question classification extracts
  useful information (i.e. answer type) about how to answer the question and document
  tagging extracts useful information from the documents, which is used in finding
  the answer to the question. For complex questions, we experimented with both empirical
  and machine learning ap- proaches. We extracted several features of different types
  (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, syntactic and semantic) for each of the sentences
  in the document collection in order to measure its relevancy to the user query.
  One hill climbing local search strategy is used to fine-tune the feature-weights.
  We also experimented with two unsupervised machine learning techniques: k-means
  and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms and evalu- ated their performance.
  For all these methods, we have shown the effects of different kinds of features.
