abstract: 'Most of the successful and predominant methods for bilingual lexicon induction
  (BLI) are mapping-based, where a linear mapping function is learned with the assumption
  that the word embedding spaces of different languages exhibit similar geometric
  structures (i.e., approximately isomorphic). However, several recent studies have
  criticized this simplified assumption showing that it does not hold in general even
  for closely related languages. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised
  method to learn cross-lingual word embeddings for BLI. Our model is independent
  of the isomorphic assumption and uses nonlinear mapping in the latent space of two
  independently trained auto-encoders. Through extensive experiments on fifteen (15)
  different language pairs (in both directions) comprising resource-rich and low-resource
  languages from two different datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
  existing models by a good margin. Ablation studies show the importance of different
  model components and the necessity of non-linear mapping.
