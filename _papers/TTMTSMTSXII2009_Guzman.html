abstract: 'In this paper we study in detail the relation between word alignment and
  phrase extraction. First, we analyze different word alignments according to several
  characteristics and compare them to hand-aligned data. Secondly, we analyzed the
  phrase-pairs generated by these alignments. We observed that the number of unaligned
  words has a large impact on the characteristics of the phrase table. A manual evaluation
  of phrase pair quality showed that the increase in the number of unaligned words
  results in a lower quality. Finally, we present translation results from using the
  number of unaligned words as features from which we obtain up to 2BP of improvement.
