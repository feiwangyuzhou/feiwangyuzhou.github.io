abstract: 'We present the Factorial Deep Markov Model (FDMM) for representation learning
  of speech. The FDMM learns disentangled, interpretable and lower dimensional latent
  representations from speech without supervision. We use a static and dynamic latent
  variable to exploit the fact that information in a speech signal evolves at different
  time scales. Latent representations learned by the FDMM outperform a baseline ivector
  system on speaker verification and dialect identification while also reducing the
  error rate of a phone recognition system in a domain mismatch scenario.
