abstract: 'Recently, neural methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results
  in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for many languages without the need for
  manually crafted features. However, these models still require manually annotated
  training data, which is not available for many languages. In this paper, we propose
  an unsupervised cross-lingual NER model that can transfer knowledge from one language
  to another in a completely unsupervised way without relying on any bilingual dictionary
  or parallel data. Our model achieves this through end-to-end parameter sharing and
  adapting to the target domain through fine-tuning. Experiments on four different
  languages demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing
  models by a good margin and setting a new SOTA for each language pair.
