abstract: 'We propose a novel framework for topic labeling that assigns the most representative
  phrases for a given set of sentences covering the same topic. We build an entailment
  graph over phrases that are extracted from the sentences, and use the entailment
  relations to identify and select the most relevant phrases. We then aggregate those
  selected phrases by means of phrase generalization and merging. We motivate our
  approach by applying over conversational data, and show that our framework improves
  performance significantly over baseline algorithms.
