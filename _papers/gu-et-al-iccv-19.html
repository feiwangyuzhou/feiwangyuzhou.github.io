abstract: 'Deep neural networks have achieved great success on the image captioning
  task. However, most of the existing models depend heavily on paired image-sentence
  datasets, which are very expensive to acquire in most real-world scenarios. In this
  paper, we propose a scene graph based approach for unpaired image captioning. Our
  method merely requires an image set, a sentence corpus, an image scene graph generator,
  and a sentence scene graph generator. The sentence corpus is used to teach the decoder
  how to generate meaningful sentences from a scene graph. To further encourage the
  generated captions to be semantically consistent with the image, we employ adversarial
  learning to align the visual scene graph to the textual scene graph. Experimental
  results show that our proposed model can generate quite promising results without
  using any image-caption training pairs, outperforming existing methods by a wide
  margin.
