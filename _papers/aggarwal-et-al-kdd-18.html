abstract: 'Physical activity and sleep play a major role in the prevention and management
  of many chronic conditions. It is not a trivial task to understand their impact
  on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health records (EHRs), sleep
  lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid increase in the popularity
  of wearable health devices provides a significant new data source, making it possible
  to track the user''s lifestyle real-time through web interfaces, both to consumer
  as well as their healthcare provider, potentially. However, at present there is
  a gap between lifestyle data (e.g., sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes
  normally captured in EHRs. This is a critical barrier for the use of this new source
  of signal for healthcare decision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data
  provides a new opportunity to overcome this barrier.To address the problem of the
  unavailability of clinical data from a major fraction of subjects and unrepresentative
  subject populations, we propose a novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series
  representation learning technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features
  by taking into account the co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity
  of human activity patterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost
  the performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since
  many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as co-morbidity,
  we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared structure of disorder
  inducing life-style choices partially captured in the wearables data. Empirical
  evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjects shows that our proposed method
  performs and generalizes substantially better than the conventional time-series
  symbolic representational methods and task-specific deep learning models.
