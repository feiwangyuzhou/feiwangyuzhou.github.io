abstract: 'Present day traffic networks are unable to efficiently handle the daily
  car traffic through urban areas. We think that multiagent systems are an excellent
  way of doing microscopic simulation and thus provide possible solutions to the traffic
  control problem. In this paper, we present our simulation-based study to simulate
  traffic networks and optimize them via a multiagent cooperative system for traffic
  light control. This system simulates the traffic on an intersection, minimizing
  the time that each car has to wait in order to be served. Light agents can communicate
  each other in order to negotiate and share their light times. Our experimental results
  have shown how our approach can decrease the average car delay while the spawn probability
  is increased varying the service time and the number of traffic lights sets at a
  specific intersection. These results show important improvements using our multiagent
  light control system.
