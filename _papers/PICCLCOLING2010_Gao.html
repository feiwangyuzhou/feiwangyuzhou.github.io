abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised word alignment technique called
  EMDC that integrates discriminative and generative methods. A discriminative aligner
  is used to find high precision partial alignments that serve as constraints for
  a generative aligner which implements a constrained version of the EM algorithm.
  Experiments on small-size Chinese and Arabic tasks show consistent improvements
  on AER. We also experimented with moderate-size Chinese machine translation tasks
  and got an average of 0.5 point improvement on BLEU scores across five standard
  NIST test sets and four other test sets.
