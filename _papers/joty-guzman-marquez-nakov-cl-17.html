abstract: 'In this article, we explore the potential of using sentence-level discourse
  structure for machine translation evaluation. We first design discourse-aware similarity
  measures, which use all- subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance
  with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show that a simple linear combination
  with these measures can help improve various existing machine translation evaluation
  metrics regarding correlation with human judgments both at the segment- and at the
  system-level. This suggests that discourse information is complementary to the information
  used by many of the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into
  account when developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined
  metric DISCOTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of various
  discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine translation
  evaluation. In particular, we show that (i) all aspects of the RST tree are relevant,
  (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii) the similarity of the
  translation RST tree to the reference RST tree is positively correlated with translation
  quality.
