  Abstract  = {Exploring an online conversation can be
very difficult for a user, especially when
it becomes a long complex thread. We follow
a human-centered design approach to
tightly integrate text mining methods with
interactive visualization techniques to support
the users in fulfilling their information
needs. The resulting visual text analytic
system provides multifaceted exploration
of asynchronous conversations. We
discuss a number of open challenges and
possible directions for further improvement
including the integration of interactive
human feedback in the text mining
loop, applying more advanced text analysis
methods with visualization techniques,
and evaluating the system with real users.},
