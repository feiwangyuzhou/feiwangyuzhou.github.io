  Abstract  = {Exploring an online conversation can be
very difficult for a user, especially when
it becomes a long complex thread. We follow
a human-centered design approach to
tightly integrate text mining methods with
interactive visualization techniques to support
the users in fulfilling their information
needs. The resulting visual text analytic
system provides multifaceted exploration
of asynchronous conversations. We
discuss a number of open challenges and
possible directions for further improvement
including the integration of interactive
human feedback in the text mining
loop, applying more advanced text analysis
methods with visualization techniques,
and evaluating the system with real users.},

  Abstract  = {This paper presents an empirical study on using syntactic and semantic information for Concept
Segmentation and Labeling (CSL), a well-known component in spoken language understanding.
Our approach is based on reranking N-best outputs from a state-of-the-art CSL parser. We
perform extensive experimentation by comparing different tree-based kernels with a variety of
representations of the available linguistic information, including semantic concepts, words, POS
tags, shallow and full syntax, and discourse trees. The results show that the structured representation
with the semantic concepts yields significant improvement over the base CSL parser, much
larger compared to learning with an explicit feature vector representation. We also show that
shallow syntax helps improve the results and that discourse relations can be partially beneficial.},
