  Abstract = { We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine translation evaluation. We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segmentand at the system-level. Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.}

  Abstract = {We present novel automatic metrics for machine translation evaluation that use discourse structure and convolution kernels to compare the discourse tree of an automatic translation with that of the human reference. We experiment with five transformations and augmentations of a base discourse tree representation based on the rhetorical structure theory, and we combine the kernel scores for each of them into a single score. Finally, we add other metrics from the ASIYA MT evaluation toolkit, and we tune the weights of the combination on actual human judgments. Experiments on the WMT12 and WMT13 metrics shared task datasets show correlation with human judgments that outperforms what the best systems that participated in these years achieved, both at the segment and at the system level.}

  Abstract = {We present a pairwise learning-to-rank approach to machine translation evaluation that learns to differentiate better from worse translations in the context of a given reference. We integrate several layers of linguistic information encapsulated in tree-based structures, making use of both the reference and the system output simultaneously, thus bringing our ranking closer to how humans evaluate translations. Most importantly, instead of deciding upfront which types of features are important, we use the learning framework of preference re-ranking kernels to learn the features automatically. The evaluation results show that learning in the proposed framework yields better correlation with humans than computing the direct similarity over the same type of structures. Also, we show our structural kernel learning (SKL) can be a general framework for MT evaluation, in which syntactic and semantic information can be naturally incorporated.}

In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is compacted into relatively small distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models the interaction between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. These compact representations are in turn based on word and sentence embeddings, which are learned using neural networks. The framework is flexible, allows for efficient learning and classification, and yields correlation with humans that rivals the state of the art.}

abstract = {Abstract We present a framework for machine translation evaluation using neural networks in a pairwise setting,
where the goal is to select the better translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation.
In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses
is embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that
models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses.
We experiment with the benchmark datasets from the \{WMT\} Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the best results published so far,
with the basic network configuration.
We also perform a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different components of the network.
We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with
convolutional and recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible and generalizable,
allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an \{MT\} evaluation metric that correlates with human judgments,
and is on par with the state of the art. }
