Abstract = {A well-written text is not merely a sequence of independent and isolated sentences, but instead a sequence of structured and related sentences. It addresses a particular topic, often covering multiple subtopics, and is organized in a coherent way that enables the reader to process the information. Discourse analysis seeks to uncover such underlying structures, which can support many applications including text summarization and information extraction.
This thesis focuses on building novel computational models of different dis- course analysis tasks in asynchronous conversations; i.e., conversations where par- ticipants communicate with each other at different times (e.g., emails, blogs). Ef- fective processing of these conversations can be of great strategic value for both organizations and individuals. We propose novel computational models for topic segmentation and labeling, rhetorical parsing and dialog act recognition in asyn- chronous conversation. Our approaches rely on two related computational method- ologies: graph theory and probabilistic graphical models.
The topic segmentation and labeling models find the high-level discourse struc- ture; i.e., the global topical structure of an asynchronous conversation. Our graph- based approach extends state-of-the-art methods by integrating a fine-grained con- versational structure with other conversational features.
On the other hand, the rhetorical parser captures the coherence structure, a finer discourse structure, by identifying coherence relations between the discourse units within each comment of the conversation. Our parser applies an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from a discriminative graphical model which allows us to represent the structure and the label of a discourse tree constituent jointly, and to capture the sequential and hierarchical dependencies between the constituents.
Finally, the dialog act model allows us to uncover the underlying dialog struc-
ture of the conversation. We present unsupervised probabilistic graphical models that capture the sequential dependencies between the acts, and show how these models can be trained more effectively based on the fine-grained conversational structure.
Together, these structures provide a deep understanding of an asynchronous conversation that can be exploited in the above-mentioned applications. For each discourse processing task, we evaluate our approach on different datasets, and show that our models consistently outperform the state-of-the-art by a wide margin. Of- ten our results are highly correlated with human annotations.

Title = {Answer Extraction for Simple and Complex Questions},
Year = {2008},
Month = {December},

url = {https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/666},
Abstract = {When a user is served with a ranked list of relevant documents by the standard docu- ment search engines, his search task is usually not over. He has to go through the entire document contents to find the precise piece of information he was looking for. Question answering, which is the retrieving of answers to natural language questions from a doc- ument collection, tries to remove the onus on the end-user by providing direct access to relevant information. This thesis is concerned with open-domain question answering. We have considered both simple and complex questions. Simple questions (i.e. factoid and list) are easier to answer than questions that have complex information needs and require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents.
Our question answering system for simple questions is based on question classification and document tagging. Question classification extracts useful information (i.e. answer type) about how to answer the question and document tagging extracts useful information from the documents, which is used in finding the answer to the question.
For complex questions, we experimented with both empirical and machine learning ap- proaches. We extracted several features of different types (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, syntactic and semantic) for each of the sentences in the document collection in order to measure its relevancy to the user query. One hill climbing local search strategy is used to fine-tune the feature-weights. We also experimented with two unsupervised machine learning techniques: k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms and evalu- ated their performance. For all these methods, we have shown the effects of different kinds of features.
