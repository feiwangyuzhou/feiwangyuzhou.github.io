  abstract={We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long range entity transitions  along with entity-specific features without loosing generalization, thanks to the power of  distributed representation. We present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and learn task-specific high level features. We further extend our approach to model discourse coherence in asynchronous conversation (e.g., forum, email) by incorporating the conversational structure into the grid representation. Our evaluation on the standard coherence assessment tasks in monologue demonstrates that our model achieves state of the art results outperforming existing models by a good margin. The evaluation on a forum dataset shows the benefit of modeling conversational structure. A further evaluation demonstrates the utility of our neural coherence model for the task of thread reconstruction in forum conversation.
