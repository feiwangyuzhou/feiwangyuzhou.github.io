Query–relevant summarization tries to remove the onus on the end–user by providing more condensed and direct access to relevant information. Query–relevant summarization is the task to synthesize a fluent, well–organized summary of the document collection that answers the user questions. We extracted several features of different types (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, statistical and cosine similarity ) for each of the sentences in the document collection in order to measure its relevancy to the user query.

We apply five different automatic annotation

measure, semantic similarity measure,

characteristics which differ from written monologues (e.g., text books, news articles)

like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variations, which are successful in
finding topics in monologue or dialog, may not be successful by themselves in
asynchronous written conversations like emails. However, an effective combination
of LDA with other important features can give us the desired results. We first
point out the specific characteristics of emails that we need to consider in order to
find the inherent topics discussed in an email conversation. Then we demonstrate
why the generative topic models by themselves may not be adequate for this task.
We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to solve the problem. Crucial to
our proposed approach is that it captures the discriminative email features and integrates
the strengths of the supervised approach with the unsupervised technique
considering LDA yet as one of the important factors.},

  Abstract = {We propose a novel approach for developing
a two-stage document-level discourse
parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree
by applying an optimal parsing algorithm
to probabilities inferred from two Conditional
Random Fields: one for intrasentential
parsing and the other for multisentential
parsing. We present two approaches
to combine these two stages of
discourse parsing effectively. A set of
empirical evaluations over two different
datasets demonstrates that our discourse
parser significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art,
often by a wide margin.},

Most importantly, instead of deciding upfront which types of features are important, we use the learning framework of preference re-ranking kernels to learn the features automatically.

structure. In this article, we present CODRA— a COmplete probabilistic Discriminative
framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory,
which posits a tree representation of a discourse.
CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First, the discourse
segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a
given text. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing
algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential
parsing and the other for multi-sentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these
two stages of parsing effectively. By conducting a series of empirical evaluations over two
different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
often by a wide margin. We also show that a reranking of the k-best parse hypotheses generated
by CODRA can potentially improve the accuracy even further.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
The importance of sleep is paramount to health. Insufficient sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights into sleep science.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality.
METHODS:
Actigraphy sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns. The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM).
RESULTS:
Deep learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. “CNN had the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared with traditional logistic regression (0.6463).
CONCLUSIONS:
Deep learning methods can predict the quality of sleep based on actigraphy data from awake periods. These predictive models can be an important tool for sleep research and to improve eHealth solutions for sleep.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of comment
classification in community Question Answering.
Following the state of the art, we approach
the task with a global inference process
to exploit the information of all comments
in the answer-thread in the form of a
fully connected graph. Our contribution comprises
two novel joint learning models that are
on-line and integrate inference within learning.
The first one jointly learns two node- and
edge-level MaxEnt classifiers with stochastic
gradient descent and integrates the inference
step with loopy belief propagation. The second
model is an instance of fully connected
pairwise CRFs (FCCRF). The FCCRF model
significantly outperforms all other approaches
and yields the best results on the task to date.
Crucial elements for its success are the global
normalization and an Ising-like edge potential.},

In this paper, we propose to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) to address two types of information needs of response organizations: 1) identifying informative tweets and 2) classifying them into topical classes. DNNs use distributed representation of words and learn the representation as well as higher level features automatically for the classification task. We propose a new online algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent to train DNNs in an online fashion during disaster situations.

We first design discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all- subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show that a simple linear combination with these measures can help improve various existing machine translation evaluation metrics regarding correlation with human judgments both at the segment- and at the system-level. This suggests that discourse information is complementary to the information used by many of the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into account when developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined metric DISCOTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of various discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine translation evaluation. In particular, we show that (i) all aspects of the RST tree are relevant, (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii) the similarity of the translation RST tree to the reference RST tree is positively correlated with translation quality.}

We also perform a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different components of the network.
We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with

We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.}

However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user's requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user, the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.}

different times, performing certain communicative acts, called speech acts (e.g., question, request).
In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to speech act recognition in asynchronous
conversations. Our approach works in two main steps: a long short-term memory recurrent
neural network (LSTM-RNN) first encodes each sentence separately into a task-specific distributed
representation, which is then used in a conditional random field (CRF) model to
capture the conversational dependencies between sentences. The LSTM-RNN uses pretrained
word embeddings learned from a large conversational corpus and is trained to classify sentences
into speech act types. The CRF model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational
dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem of
limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the LSTM-RNN model to learn
from synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings) using domain adversarial training of neural
networks. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: (i)
LSTM-RNNs provide better task-specific representations, (ii) conversational word embeddings
benefit the LSTM-RNNs more than the off-the-shelf ones, (iii) adversarial training gives better
domain-invariant representations, and (iv) the global CRF model improves over local models.

  abstract={In recent years there has been a growing interest in deep neural networks (DNN)
and representation learning with applications to a myriad of NLP and data
mining problems. The success of DNNs is heavily dependent on the availability
of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data is a big challenge in many
real-world problems. In such cases, a DNN model can leverage labeled and
unlabeled data from a related domain, but it has to deal with the shift in data
distributions between the domains. In this paper, we study the problem of
classifying social media posts during a crisis event (e.g., Earthquake). For
that, we use labeled and unlabeled data from past similar events (e.g., Flood)
and unlabeled data for the current event. We propose a novel model that
performs adversarial learning based domain adaptation to deal with distribution
drifts and graph based semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data
within a single unified deep learning framework.
Our experiments with two real-world crisis datasets collected from Twitter
demonstrate significant improvements over several baselines.}

In general, the mapping function is learned from a training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale image-caption paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to this unpaired image captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can effectively capture the characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot language (Chinese) and align it to the target language (English) using another pivot-target (Chinese-English) parallel corpus. We evaluate our method on two image-to-English benchmark datasets: MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Quantitative comparisons against several baseline approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.}

To this end, we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA with Explanation), where the computational models are required to generate an explanation with the predicted answer. We first construct a new dataset, and then frame the VQA-E problem in a multi-task learning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically derived from the VQA v2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions. We have conducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized by our method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision from explanations can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify the answers, but also improve the performance of answer prediction. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2 dataset.}

Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is no mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of sleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism.  We propose, for the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flow signal. Deep neural networks have recently shown high accuracy on sleep staging by eliminating handcrafted features. However, these methods focus exclusively on extracting informative features from the input signal, without paying much attention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output sequence.  We propose an end-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrent neural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with a structured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the temporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous methods by 10\% 
using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep staging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to accurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep stages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on sleep apnea patients. Apart from the technical contributions, we expect this study to motivate new research questions in sleep science.

We use sophisticated composition methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a distributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to effectively capture similarities be- tween tuples. We consider both the case where pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are not; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations that are customized for a specific ER task under different scenarios. We propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking approach that takes all at- tributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks, compared with traditional methods that con- sider only a few attributes. We evaluate our algorithms on multiple datasets (including benchmarks, biomedical data, as well as multi-lingual data) and the extensive experimental results show that DeepER outperforms existing solutions.}

and written conversations, with a focus on computational models for three related topics: conversational
structure, summarization and sentiment detection, and group dynamics. We provide examples of specific
NLP tasks within those three areas, how they relate to one another, their applications, and how we
evaluate task performance.
We will begin by discussing motivations and applications of applying NLP methods to conversations,
including downstream applications that could benefit. Attendees will hear about the challenges of working
with noisy data, and examples of datasets of spoken and/or written conversations.
The first part of the tutorial covers conversational structures, the basic building blocks for working
with conversational data. Participants will learn about computational methods for uncovering thread and
topic structures of a conversation, detecting dialogue acts and adjacency pairs, identifying participant
roles (where relevant), and how to treat disfluencies. We will cover methods for both synchronous (e.g.,
meeting, phone) and asynchronous (e.g., forum, email) conversations.
In the second part of the tutorial, we will focus on sentiment analysis and summarization. Attendees
will learn about the related, overlapping tasks of detecting sentiment, subjectivity, and opinions. We will
cover unsupervised and supervised approaches, as well as multimodal sentiment detection. Participants
will learn about intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation of sentiment analysis methods for conversations.
For summarization, we will cover core topics, such as the notions of extractive vs. abstractive summarization,
and summarization vs. compression. In particular, participants will learn about the limits of
extractive summarization on noisy and opinion-filled conversation data. We will particularly emphasize
the question of how to evaluate automatically generated summaries, including some of the controversial
history surrounding automatic summarization metrics that are widely used.
In the final part of the tutorial, participants will learn about the growing field of research that uses NLP
and machine learning methods to model and predict group dynamics, including prediction of group
performance and participant affect. Attendees will learn about the close relationship between these three
areas of summarization, sentiment, and group dynamics, and why researchers in each one of those areas
often end up being concerned with the other two topics as well. Finally, we will discuss promising
current and future directions of applying NLP to conversations.}

Without adding any extra parameters to the Pointer-Generator baseline, our attention mechanism yields significant improvements in ROUGE scores and generates summaries of better quality measured from several aspects. Our method within the Pointer-Generator framework outperforms the recently proposed Transformer-based model for summarization while using only 5 times less parameters. When applied to the encoder-decoder attention in the Transformer model initialized with BERT, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in abstractive summarization.},

In this paper, we propose a scene graph based approach for unpaired image captioning. Our method merely requires an image set, a sentence corpus, an image scene graph generator, and a sentence scene graph generator. The sentence corpus is used to teach the decoder how to generate meaningful sentences from a scene graph. To further encourage the generated captions to be semantically consistent with the image, we employ adversarial learning to align the visual scene graph to the textual scene graph. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generate quite promising results without using any image-caption training pairs, outperforming existing methods by a wide margin.}

The state-of-the-art video captioning methods focus more on encoding the temporal information, while lack of effective ways to remove irrelevant temporal information and also neglecting the spatial details. However, the current RNN encoding module in single time order can be influenced by the irrelevant temporal information, especially the irrelevant temporal information is at the beginning of the encoding. In addition, neglecting spatial information will lead to the relationship confusion of the words and detailed loss. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel recurrent video encoding method and a novel visual spatial feature for the video captioning task. The recurrent encoding module encodes the video twice with the predicted key frame to avoid the irrelevant temporal information often occurring at the beginning and the end of a video. The novel spatial features represent the spatial information in different regions of a video and enrich the details of a caption.

  abstract = {Claim verification is generally a task of verifying the veracity of a given claim, which is critical to many downstream applications. It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent evidences, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidences as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidences considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the the embedded evidences. 
Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract  = {Discourse processing is a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks to uncover linguistic structures from texts at several levels, which can support many downstream applications. This involves identifying the topic structure, the coherence structure, the coreference structure, and the conversation structure for conversational discourse. Taken together, these structures can inform text summarization, machine translation, essay scoring, sentiment analysis,  information extraction, question answering, and thread recovery. The tutorial starts with an overview of basic concepts in discourse analysis -- monologue vs. conversation, synchronous vs. asynchronous conversation, and key linguistic structures in discourse analysis. We also give an overview of linguistic structures and corresponding discourse analysis tasks that discourse researchers are generally interested in, as well as key applications on which these discourse structures have an impact.}

success in learning bilingual dictionary without

work has shown superior performance for

autoencoder for unsupervised word
translation and propose two novel extensions
to it that yield more stable training and improved
results. Our method includes regularization
terms to enforce cycle consistency and
input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders
as an adversary against the corresponding
discriminator. Extensive experimentations
with European and non-European languages
show that our method achieves better performance
than recently proposed adversarial and
non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive
with the supervised system.},

(SAR) in asynchronous conversations

synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings,
phone), asynchronous domains lack large labeled
datasets to train an effective SAR model.
In this paper, we propose methods to effectively
leverage abundant unlabeled conversational
data and the available labeled data from
synchronous domains. We carry out our research
in three main steps. First, we introduce
a neural architecture based on hierarchical
LSTMs and conditional random fields (CRF)
for SAR in asynchronous conversations, and
show that our method outperforms existing
methods when trained on in-domain data only.
Second, we improve our initial SAR models
by semi-supervised learning in the form of
pretrained word embeddings learned from a
large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally,
we employ adversarial training to improve the
results further by leveraging the labeled data
from synchronous domains and by explicitly
modeling the shift in two domains.},

Being able to proactively screen and monitor such chronic conditions would be a big step forward for overall health. The rapid increase in the popularity of wearable devices provides a significant new source, making it possible to track the user’s lifestyle real-time. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning technique called activ- ity2vec that learns and “summarizes” the discrete-valued ac- tivity time-series. It learns the representations with three com- ponents: (i) the co-occurrence and magnitude of the activity levels in a time-segment, (ii) neighboring context of the time- segment, and (iii) promoting subject-invariance with adver- sarial training. We evaluate our method on four disorder pre- diction tasks using linear classifiers. Empirical evaluation and analysis demonstrate that our proposed method performs bet- ter than many strong baselines, and adversarial learning helps improve the generalizability of our representations by pro- moting subject invariant features. We also show that using the representations at the level of a day works the best since human activity is structured in terms of daily routines.}

produces a query execution plan (qep) which represents an

it is often difficult for a student to comprehend the query execution
strategy by perusing the qep, hindering her learning
process. In this demonstration, we present a novel system
called neuron that facilitates natural language interaction
with qeps to enhance its understanding. neuron accepts a
sql query (which may include joins, aggregation, nesting,
among other things) as input, executes it, and generates a
simplified natural language-based description (both in text
and voice form) of the execution strategy deployed by the
underlying rdbms. Furthermore, it facilitates understanding
of various features related to the qep through a natural
language-based question answering framework.We advocate
that such tool, world’s first of its kind, can greatly enhance
students’ learning of the query optimization topic.}

abstract = {Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14 English-German task. It also yields improvements over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.}
