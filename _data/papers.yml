      One of the main challenges in the applica- tions (i.e.: text summarization, question an- swering, information retrieval, etc.) of Natural Language Processing is to deter- mine which of the several senses of a word is used in a given context. The problem is phrased as “Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)” in the NLP community. This paper presents the dictionary based disambigua- tion technique that adopts the assumption of one sense per discourse in the context of SemEval-2007 Task 7: “Coarse-grained English all-words”.

      We consider the problem of answering complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents and can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization. The stochastic, graph-based method for computing the relative importance of textual units (i.e. sentences) is very successful in generic summarization. In this method, a sentence is encoded as a vector in which each component represents the occurrence frequency (TF*IDF) of a word. However, the major limitation of the TF*IDF approach is that it only retains the frequency of the words and does not take into account the sequence, syntactic and semantic information. In this paper, we study the impact of syntactic and shallow semantic information in the graph-based method for answering complex questions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the syntactic and shallow semantic information for this task.

      Unlike simple questions, complex questions cannot be answered by simply extracting named entities. These questions require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents that can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization. In this paper, we have experimented with one empirical and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. The feature set includes different kinds of features: lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic. A gradient descent local search technique is used to learn the optimal weights of the features. The effects of the different features are also shown for all the methods of generating summaries.

    abstract: >
      When a user is served with a ranked list of relevant documents by the standard document search engines, his search task is usually not over. He has to go through the entire document contents to judge its relevance and to find the precise piece of information he was looking for. Query–relevant summarization tries to remove the onus on the end–user by providing more condensed and direct access to relevant information. Query–relevant summarization is the task to synthesize a fluent, well–organized summary of the document collection that answers the user questions. We extracted several features of different types (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, statistical and cosine similarity ) for each of the sentences in the document collection in order to measure its relevancy to the user query. We experimented with two well–known unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: K–means and EM algorithms and evaluated their performances. For all these methods of generating summaries, we have shown the effects of different kinds of features.

      Complex questions that require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization where the goal is to produce a single text as a compressed version of a set of documents with a minimum loss of relevant information. In this paper, we experiment with one empirical method and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. We compare the results of these approaches. Our experiments show that the empirical approach outperforms the other two techniques and EM performs better than K-means. However, the performance of these approaches depends entirely on the feature set used and the weighting of these features. In order to measure the importance and relevance to the user query we extract different kinds of features (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic) for each of the document sentences. We use a local search technique to learn the weights of the features. To the best of our knowledge, no study has used tree kernel functions to encode syntactic/semantic information for more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between the query sentences and the document sentences in order to generate query-focused summaries (or answers to complex questions). For each of our methods of generating summaries (i.e. empirical, K-means and EM) we show the effects of syntactic and shallow-semantic features over the bag-of-words (BOW) features.

      In this paper, we analyze the impact of different automatic annotation methods on the performance of supervised approaches to the complex question answering problem (defined in the DUC-2007 main task). Huge amount of annotated or labeled data is a prerequisite for supervised training. The task of labeling can be accomplished either by humans or by computer programs. When humans are employed, the whole process becomes time consuming and expensive. So, in order to produce a large set of labeled data we prefer the automatic annotation strategy. We apply five different automatic annotation techniques to produce labeled data using ROUGE similarity measure, Basic Element (BE) overlap, syntactic similarity measure, semantic similarity measure, and Extended String Subsequence Kernel (ESSK). The representative supervised methods we use are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Evaluation results are presented to show the impact.

Although SVM can have a good generalization ability, it may experience a performance degradation through wrong classifications. We use a committee of several SVMs, i.e. Cross-Validation Committees (CVC), to form an ensemble of classifiers where the strategy is to improve the performance by correcting errors of one classifier using the accurate output of others. The practicality and effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated using the experimental results.

      Our research addresses the task of finding topics at the sentence level in email conversations. As an asynchronous collaborative application, email has its own characteristics which differ from written monologues (e.g., text books, news articles) or spoken dialogs (e.g., meetings). Hence, the generative topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variations, which are successful in finding topics in monologue or dialog, may not be successful by themselves in asynchronous written conversations like emails. However, an effective combination of LDA with other important features can give us the desired results. We first point out the specific characteristics of emails that we need to consider in order to find the inherent topics discussed in an email conversation. Then we demonstrate why the generative topic models by themselves may not be adequate for this task. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to solve the problem. Crucial to our proposed approach is that it captures the discriminative email features and integrates the strengths of the supervised approach with the unsupervised technique considering LDA yet as one of the important factors.

      This work concerns automatic topic segmentation of email conversations. We present a corpus of email threads manually annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliability. To our knowledge, this is the first such email corpus. We show how the existing topic segmentation models (i.e., Lexical Chain Segmenter (LCSeg) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)) which are solely based on lexical information, can be applied to emails. By pointing out where these methods fail and what any desired model should consider, we propose two novel extensions of the models that not only use lexical information but also exploit finer level conversation structure in a principled way. Empirical evaluation shows that LCSeg is a better model than LDA for segmenting an email thread into topical clusters and incorporating conversation structure into these models improves the performance significantly

      The task of answering complex questions requires inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents that can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization. In generic summarization the stochastic, graph-based random walk method to compute the relative importance of textual units (i.e. sentences) is proved to be very successful. However, the major limitation of the TF^*IDF approach is that it only retains the frequency of the words and does not take into account the sequence, syntactic and semantic information. This paper presents the impact of syntactic and semantic information in the graph-based random walk method for answering complex questions. Initially, we apply tree kernel functions to perform the similarity measures between sentences in the random walk framework. Then, we extend our work further to incorporate the Extended String Subsequence Kernel (ESSK) to perform the task in a similar manner. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the use of kernels to include the syntactic and semantic information for this task.

    abstract: >
      We present unsupervised approaches to the problem of modeling dialog acts in asynchronous conversations; i.e., conversations where participants collaborate with each other at different times. In particular, we investigate a graph-theoretic deterministic framework and two probabilistic conversation models (i.e., HMM and HMM+Mix) for modeling dialog acts in emails and forums. We train and test our conversation models on (a) temporal order and (b) graph-structural order of the datasets.

      We propose a graph-theoretic supervised topic segmentation model for email conversations which combines (i) lexical knowledge, (ii) conversational features, and (iii) topic features. We compare our results with the existing unsupervised models (i.e., LCSeg and LDA), and with their two extensions for email conversations (i.e., LCSeg+FQG and LDA+FQG) that not only use lexical information but also exploit finer conversation structure. Empirical evaluation shows that our supervised model is the best performer and achieves highest accuracy by combining the three different knowledge sources, where knowledge about the conversation has proved to be the most important indicator for segmenting emails.

      Topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for higher-level conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. We present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations. We propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations. Our approach extends state-of-the-art methods by considering a fine-grained structure of an asynchronous conversation, along with other conversational features by applying recent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation, we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the fine-grained conversational structure, and a novel graph-theoretic supervised model that combines lexical, conversational and topic features. For topic labeling, we propose two novel (unsupervised) random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources: the leading sentences and the fine-grained conversational structure. Empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the state-of-the-art, and are highly correlated with human annotations.

We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segmentand at the system-level. Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.

      We present a pairwise learning-to-rank approach to machine translation evaluation that learns to differentiate better from worse translations in the context of a given reference. We integrate several layers of linguistic information encapsulated in tree-based structures, making use of both the reference and the system output simultaneously, thus bringing our ranking closer to how humans evaluate translations. Most importantly, instead of deciding upfront which types of features are important, we use the learning framework of preference re-ranking kernels to learn the features automatically. The evaluation results show that learning in the proposed framework yields better correlation with humans than computing the direct similarity over the same type of structures. Also, we show our structural kernel learning (SKL) can be a general framework for MT evaluation, in which syntactic and semantic information can be naturally incorporated.

      We present novel automatic metrics for machine translation evaluation that use discourse structure and convolution kernels to compare the discourse tree of an automatic translation with that of the human reference. We experiment with five transformations and augmentations of a base discourse tree representation based on the rhetorical structure theory, and we combine the kernel scores for each of them into a single score. Finally, we add other metrics from the ASIYA MT evaluation toolkit, and we tune the weights of the combination on actual human judgments. Experiments on the WMT12 and WMT13 metrics shared task datasets show correlation with human judgments that outperforms what the best systems that participated in these years achieved, both at the segment and at the system level.

      Exploring an online conversation can be very difficult for a user, especially when it becomes a long complex thread. We follow a human-centered design approach to tightly integrate text mining methods with interactive visualization techniques to support the users in fulfilling their information needs. The resulting visual text analytic system provides multifaceted exploration of asynchronous conversations. We discuss a number of open challenges and possible directions for further improvement including the integration of interactive human feedback in the text mining loop, applying more advanced text analysis methods with visualization techniques, and evaluating the system with real users.

      In this paper, we present a discriminative approach for reranking discourse trees generated by an existing probabilistic discourse parser. The reranker relies on tree kernels (TKs) to capture the global dependencies between discourse units in a tree. In particular, we design new computational structures of discourse trees, which combined with standard TKs, originate novel discourse TKs. The empirical evaluation shows that our reranker can improve the state-of-the-art sentence-level parsing accuracy from 79.77% to 82.15%, a relative error reduction of 11.8%, which in turn pushes the state-of-the-art documentlevel accuracy from 55.8% to 57.3%.

We represent the alternative analyses output by a state-of-the-art CSL parser with tree structures, which we rerank with a classifier trained on two types of semantic tree kernels: one processing structures built with words, concepts and Brown clusters, and another one using semantic similarity among the words composing the structure. The results on a corpus from the restaurant domain show that our semantic kernels exploiting similarity measures outperform state-of-the-art rerankers.

      This paper presents an empirical study on using syntactic and semantic information for Concept Segmentation and Labeling (CSL), a well-known component in spoken language understanding. Our approach is based on reranking N-best outputs from a state-of-the-art CSL parser. We perform extensive experimentation by comparing different tree-based kernels with a variety of representations of the available linguistic information, including semantic concepts, words, POS tags, shallow and full syntax, and discourse trees. The results show that the structured representation with the semantic concepts yields significant improvement over the base CSL parser, much larger compared to learning with an explicit feature vector representation. We also show that shallow syntax helps improve the results and that discourse relations can be partially beneficial.

      Clauses and sentences rarely stand on their own in an actual discourse; rather, the relationship between them carries important information that allows the discourse to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its individual parts. Rhetorical analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure. In this article, we present CODRA— a COmplete probabilistic Discriminative framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory, which posits a tree representation of a discourse. CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First, the discourse segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a given text. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential parsing and the other for multi-sentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these two stages of parsing effectively. By conducting a series of empirical evaluations over two different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, often by a wide margin. We also show that a reranking of the k-best parse hypotheses generated by CODRA can potentially improve the accuracy even further.

      We present a novel framework for machine translation evaluation using neural networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is compacted into relatively small distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models the interaction between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. These compact representations are in turn based on word and sentence embeddings, which are learned using neural networks. The framework is flexible, allows for efficient learning and classification, and yields correlation with humans that rivals the state of the art.

      Community Question Answering (cQA) is a new application of QA in social contexts (e.g., fora). It presents new interesting challenges and research directions, e.g., exploiting the dependencies between the different comments of a thread to select the best answer for a given question. In this paper, we explored two ways of modeling such dependencies: (i) by designing specific features looking globally at the thread; and (ii) by applying structure prediction models. We trained and evaluated our models on data from SemEval-2015 Task 3 on Answer Selection in cQA. Our experiments show that: (i) the thread-level features consistently improve the performance for a variety of machine learning models, yielding state-of-the-art results; and (ii) sequential dependencies between the answer labels captured by structured prediction models are not enough to improve the results, indicating that more information is needed in the joint model.

      Joint models have recently shown to improve the state-of-the-art in machine translation (MT). We apply EM-based mixture modeling and data selection techniques using two joint models, namely the Operation Sequence Model or OSM — an ngram-based translation and reordering model, and the Neural Network Joint Model or NNJM — a continuous space translation model, to carry out domain adaptation for MT. The diversity of the two models, OSM with inherit reordering information and NNJM with continuous space modeling makes them interesting to be explored for this task. Our contribution in this paper is fusing the existing known techniques (linear interpolation, cross-entropy) with the state-of-the-art MT models (OSM, NNJM). On a standard task of translating German-to-English and Arabic-to-English IWSLT TED talks, we observed statistically significant improvements of up to +0.9 BLEU points.

      We present novel models for domain adaptation based on the neural network joint model (NNJM). Our models maximize the cross entropy by regularizing the loss function with respect to in-domain model. Domain adaptation is carried out by assigning higher weight to out-domain sequences that are similar to the in-domain data. In our alternative model we take a more restrictive approach by additionally penalizing sequences similar to the outdomain data. Our models achieve better perplexities than the baseline NNJM models and give improvements of up to 0.5 and 0.6 BLEU points in Arabic-to-English and English-to-German language pairs, on a standard task of translating TED talks.

      The tasks in fine-grained opinion mining can be regarded as either a token-level sequence labeling problem or as a semantic compositional task. We propose a general class of discriminative models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and word embeddings that can be successfully applied to such tasks without any taskspecific feature engineering effort. Our experimental results on the task of opinion target identification show that RNNs, without using any hand-crafted features, outperform feature-rich CRF-based models. Our framework is flexible, allows us to incorporate other linguistic features, and achieves results that rival the top performing systems in SemEval-2014.

      Community question answering, a recent evolution of question answering in the Web context, allows a user to quickly consult the opinion of a number of people on a particular topic, thus taking advantage of the wisdom of the crowd. Here we try to help the user by deciding automatically which answers are good and which are bad for a given question. In particular, we focus on exploiting the output structure at the thread level in order to make more consistent global decisions. More specifically, we exploit the relations between pairs of comments at any distance in the thread, which we incorporate in a graph-cut and in an ILP frameworks. We evaluated our approach on the benchmark dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 3. Results improved over the state of the art, confirming the importance of using thread level information.

      BACKGROUND: The importance of sleep is paramount to health. Insufficient sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights into sleep science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality. METHODS: Actigraphy sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns. The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM). RESULTS: Deep learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. “CNN had the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared with traditional logistic regression (0.6463). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning methods can predict the quality of sleep based on actigraphy data from awake periods. These predictive models can be an important tool for sleep research and to improve eHealth solutions for sleep.

      This paper addresses the problem of speech act recognition in written asynchronous conversations (e.g., fora, emails). We propose a class of conditional structured models defined over arbitrary graph structures to capture the conversational dependencies between sentences. Our models use sentence representations encoded by a long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural model. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: (i) LSTMs provide better task-specific representations, and (ii) the global joint model improves over local models.

      This paper addresses the problem of comment classification in community Question Answering. Following the state of the art, we approach the task with a global inference process to exploit the information of all comments in the answer-thread in the form of a fully connected graph. Our contribution comprises two novel joint learning models that are on-line and integrate inference within learning. The first one jointly learns two node- and edge-level MaxEnt classifiers with stochastic gradient descent and integrates the inference step with loopy belief propagation. The second model is an instance of fully connected pairwise CRFs (FCCRF). The FCCRF model significantly outperforms all other approaches and yields the best results on the task to date. Crucial elements for its success are the global normalization and an Ising-like edge potential.

      We present a novel fusion model for domain adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation. Our model is based on the joint source-target neural network (Devlin et al., 2014), and is learned by fusing in- and out-domain models. The adaptation is performed by backpropagating errors from the output layer to the word embedding layer of each model, subsequently adjusting parameters of the composite model towards the in-domain data. On the standard tasks of translating English-to-German and Arabic-to-English TED talks, we observed average improvements of +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively over a competition grade phrase-based system. We also demonstrate improvements over existing adaptation methods.

The task targeted the reranking of questions and comments in real-life web fora both in English and Arabic. ConvKN combines convolutional tree kernels with convolutional neural networks and additional manually designed features including text similarity and thread specific features. For the first time, we applied tree kernels to syntactic trees of Arabic sentences for a reranking task. Our approaches obtained the second best results in three out of four tasks. The only task we performed averagely is the one where we did not use tree kernels in our classifier.

      During natural or man-made disasters, humanitarian response organizations look for useful information to support their decision-making processes. Social media platforms such as Twitter have been considered as a vital source of useful information for disaster response and management. Despite advances in natural language processing techniques, processing short and informal Twitter messages is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) to address two types of information needs of response organizations: 1) identifying informative tweets and 2) classifying them into topical classes. DNNs use distributed representation of words and learn the representation as well as higher level features automatically for the classification task. We propose a new online algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent to train DNNs in an online fashion during disaster situations. We test our models using a crisis-related real-world Twitter dataset.

      In this article, we explore the potential of using sentence-level discourse structure for machine translation evaluation. We first design discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all- subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show that a simple linear combination with these measures can help improve various existing machine translation evaluation metrics regarding correlation with human judgments both at the segment- and at the system-level. This suggests that discourse information is complementary to the information used by many of the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into account when developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined metric DISCOTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of various discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine translation evaluation. In particular, we show that (i) all aspects of the RST tree are relevant, (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii) the similarity of the translation RST tree to the reference RST tree is positively correlated with translation quality.

      We explore neural joint models for the task of domain adaptation in machine translation in two ways: (i) we apply state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques, such as mixture modelling and data selection using the recently proposed Neural Network Joint Model (NNJM) (Devlin et al., 2014); (ii) we propose two novel approaches to perform adaptation through instance weighting and weight readjustment in the NNJM framework. In our first approach, we propose a pair of models called Neural Domain Adaptation Models (NDAM) that minimizes the cross entropy by regularizing the loss function with respect to in-domain (and optionally to out-domain) model. In the second approach, we present a set of Neural Fusion Models (NFM) that combines the in- and the out-domain models by readjusting their parameters based on the in-domain data. We evaluated our models on the standard task of translating English-to-German and Arabic-to-English TED talks. The NDAM models achieved better perplexities and modest BLEU improvements compared to the baseline NNJM, trained either on in-domain or on a concatenation of in- and out-domain data. On the other hand, the NFM models obtained significant improvements of up to +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively. We also demonstrate improvements over existing adaptation methods such as instance weighting, phrasetable fill-up, linear and log-linear interpolations.

      Abstract We present a framework for machine translation evaluation using neural networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. We experiment with the benchmark datasets from the \WMT\ Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the best results published so far, with the basic network configuration. We also perform a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different components of the network. We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible and generalizable, allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an \MT\ evaluation metric that correlates with human judgments, and is on par with the state of the art.

      In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses
      is embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that
      models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses.
      We experiment with the benchmark datasets from the \{WMT\} Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the best results published so far, with the basic network configuration.

      We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network that operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long range entity transitions along with entity-specific features without loosing generalization, thanks to the power of distributed representation. We present a pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task and learn task-specific high level features. Our evaluation on three different coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that our model achieves state of the art results outperforming existing models by a good margin.

      We present a novel approach to learn distributed representation of sentences from unlabeled data by modeling both content and context of a sentence. The content model learns sentence representation by predicting its words. On the other hand, the context model comprises a neighbor prediction component and a regularizer to model distributional and proximity hypotheses, respectively. We propose an online algorithm to train the model components jointly. We evaluate the models in a setup, where contextual information is available. The experimental results on tasks involving classification, clustering, and ranking of sentences show that our model outperforms the best existing models by a wide margin across multiple datasets.

      Vector representation of sentences is important for many text processing tasks that involve classifying, clustering, or ranking sentences. For solving these tasks, bag-of-word based representation has been used for a long time. In recent years, distributed representation of sentences learned by neural models from unlabeled data has been shown to outperform traditional bag-of-words representations. However, most existing methods belonging to the neural models consider only the content of a sentence, and disregard its relations with other sentences in the context. In this paper, we first characterize two types of contexts depending on their scope and utility. We then propose two approaches to incorporate  contextual information into content-based models. We evaluate our sentence representation models in a setup, where context is available to infer sentence vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models outshine existing models on three fundamental tasks, such as, classifying, clustering, and ranking sentences.

      We study how to find relevant questions in community forums when the language of the new questions is different from that of the existing questions in the forum. In particular, we explore the Arabic-English language pair. We compare a kernel-based system with a feed-forward neural network in a scenario where a large parallel corpus is available for training a machine translation system, bilingual dictionaries, and cross-language word embeddings. We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.

      The role of social media, in particular microblogging platforms such as Twitter, as a conduit for actionable and tactical information during disasters is increasingly acknowledged. However, time-critical analysis of big crisis data on social media streams brings challenges to machine learning techniques, especially the ones that use supervised learning. The scarcity of labeled data, particularly in the early hours of a crisis, delays the learning process. Existing classification methods require a significant amount of labeled data specific to a particular event for training plus a lot of feature engineering to achieve best results. In this work, we introduce neural network based classification methods for identifying useful tweets during a crisis situation. At the onset of a disaster when no labeled data is available, our proposed method makes the best use of the out-of-event data and achieves good results.

      Community question answering (CQA) forums can provide effective means for sharing information and addressing a user's information needs about particular topics. However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user's requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user, the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.

      Most state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems, despite being different in architectural skeletons (e.g. recurrence, convolutional), share an indispensable feature: the Attention. However, most existing attention methods are token-based and ignore the importance of phrasal alignments, the key ingredient for the success of phrase-based statistical machine translation. In this paper, we propose novel phrase-based attention methods to model n-grams of tokens as attention entities.

      Participants in asynchronous conversations (e.g., forums, emails) interact with each other at different times, performing certain communicative acts, called speech acts (e.g., question, request). In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to speech act recognition in asynchronous conversations. Our approach works in two main steps: a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) first encodes each sentence separately into a task-specific distributed representation, which is then used in a conditional random field (CRF) model to capture the conversational dependencies between sentences. The LSTM-RNN uses pretrained word embeddings learned from a large conversational corpus and is trained to classify sentences into speech act types. The CRF model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem of limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the LSTM-RNN model to learn from synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings) using domain adversarial training of neural networks. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: (i) LSTM-RNNs provide better task-specific representations, (ii) conversational word embeddings benefit the LSTM-RNNs more than the off-the-shelf ones, (iii) adversarial training gives better domain-invariant representations, and (iv) the global CRF model improves over local models.

      We address, for the first time, the joint resolution of two important Question Answering tasks on community forums: given a new question, (i) find related existing questions, and (ii) find relevant answers to the new question. We further use an auxiliary task to complement the previous two, i.e., (iii) find good answers with respect to the thread question in a question-comment thread. We use deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn meaningful task-specific embeddings, which we then incorporate into a conditional random field (CRF) model on the multitask problem, performing joint learning over arbitrary graph structures. The experimental results show that DNNs alone achieve competitive results when trained to produce the embeddings. Furthermore, the CRF model is able to effectively make use of the embeddings and the dependencies between the tasks to improve results significantly and consistently across a variety of evaluation metrics, thus showing the complementarity of DNNs and structured learning.

We conduct our research in two steps. First, we propose improvements to the recently proposed neural entity grid model by lexicalizing its entity transitions. Then, we extend the model to asynchronous conversations by incorporating the underlying conversational structure in the entity grid representation and feature computation. Our model achieves state of the art results on standard coherence assessment tasks in monologue and conversations outperforming existing models.

      In recent years there has been a growing interest in deep neural networks (DNN) and representation learning with applications to a myriad of NLP and data mining problems. The success of DNNs is heavily dependent on the availability of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data is a big challenge in many real-world problems. In such cases, a DNN model can leverage labeled and unlabeled data from a related domain, but it has to deal with the shift in data distributions between the domains. In this paper, we study the problem of classifying social media posts during a crisis event (e.g., Earthquake). For that, we use labeled and unlabeled data from past similar events (e.g., Flood) and unlabeled data for the current event. We propose a novel model that performs adversarial learning based domain adaptation to deal with distribution drifts and graph based semi-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data within a single unified deep learning framework. Our experiments with two real-world crisis datasets collected from Twitter demonstrate significant improvements over several baselines.

      Image captioning is a multimodal task involving computer vision and natural language processing, where the goal is to learn a mapping from the image to its natural language description. In general, the mapping function is learned from a training set of image-caption pairs. However, for some language, large scale image-caption paired corpus might not be available. We present an approach to this unpaired image captioning problem by language pivoting. Our method can effectively capture the characteristics of an image captioner from the pivot language (Chinese) and align it to the target language (English) using another pivot-target (Chinese-English) parallel corpus. We evaluate our method on two image-to-English benchmark datasets: MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Quantitative comparisons against several baseline approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

      Most existing works in visual question answering (VQA) are dedicated to improving the accuracy of predicted answers, while disregarding the explanations. We argue that the explanation for an answer is of the same or even more importance compared with the answer itself, since it makes the question and answering process more understandable and traceable. To this end, we propose a new task of VQA-E (VQA with Explanation), where the computational models are required to generate an explanation with the predicted answer. We first construct a new dataset, and then frame the VQA-E problem in a multi-task learning architecture. Our VQA-E dataset is automatically derived from the VQA v2 dataset by intelligently exploiting the available captions. We have conducted a user study to validate the quality of explanations synthesized by our method. We quantitatively show that the additional supervision from explanations can not only produce insightful textual sentences to justify the answers, but also improve the performance of answer prediction. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin on the VQA v2 dataset.

      Textual-visual cross-modal retrieval has been a hot research topic in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Learning appropriate representations for multi-modal data is crucial for the cross-modal retrieval performance. Unlike existing image-text retrieval approaches that embed image-text pairs as single feature vectors in a common representational space, we propose to incorporate generative processes into the cross-modal feature embedding, through which we are able to learn not only the global abstract features but also the local grounded features. Extensive experiments show that our framework can well match images and sentences with complex content, and achieve the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval results on MSCOCO dataset.

      Textual reviews, which are readily available on many e-commerce and review websites such as Amazon and Yelp, serve as an invaluable source of information for recommender systems. However, not all parts of the reviews are equally important, and the same choice of words may reflect a different meaning based on its context. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Aspect-based Neural Recommender (ANR) to perform aspect-based representation learning for both users and items via an attention-based component. Furthermore, we model the multi-faceted process behind how users rate items by estimating the aspect-level user and item importance by adapting the neural co-attention mechanism. Our proposed model concurrently address several shortcomings of existing recommender systems, and a thorough experimental study on 25 benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp shows that ANR significantly outperforms recently proposed state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCoNN, D-Attn and ALFM.

Our proposed model concurrently address several shortcomings of existing recommender systems, and a thorough experimental study on 25 benchmark datasets from Amazon and Yelp shows that ANR significantly outperforms recently proposed state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCoNN, D-Attn and ALFM.},

      Text segmentation is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Depending on the levels of granularity, the task can be defined as segmenting a document into topical segments, or segmenting a sentence into elementary discourse units. Traditional solutions to the two tasks heavily rely on carefully designed features. The recently proposed neural models do not need manual feature engineering, but they either suffer from sparse boundary tags or they cannot well handle the issue of variable size output vocabulary. Our generic end-to-end segmentation model, named SEGBOT, uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network to encode input text sequence. The model then uses another recurrent neural network together with a pointer network to select text boundaries in the input sequence. In this way, SEGBOT does not require hand-crafted features. More importantly, our model inherently handles the issue of variable size output vocabulary and the issue of sparse boundary tags. In our experiments, SEGBOT outperforms state-of-the-art models on two tasks, document-level topic segmentation and sentence-level discourse segmentation.

      Sleep plays a vital role in human health, both mental and physical. Sleep disorders like sleep apnea are increasing in prevalence, with the rapid increase in factors like obesity.  Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is no mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of sleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism.  We propose, for the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flow signal. Deep neural networks have recently shown high accuracy on sleep staging by eliminating handcrafted features. However, these methods focus exclusively on extracting informative features from the input signal, without paying much attention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output sequence.  We propose an end-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrent neural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with a structured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the temporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous methods by 10\% using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep staging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to accurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep stages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on sleep apnea patients. Apart from the technical contributions, we expect this study to motivate new research questions in sleep science.

    abstract: >
      Despite the efforts in 70+ years in all aspects of Entity res- olution (ER), there is still a high demand for democratizing ER – by reducing the heavy human involvement in label- ing data, performing feature engineering, tuning parameters, and defining blocking functions. With the recent advances in deep learning, in particular distributed representations of words (a.k.a. word embeddings), we present a novel ER sys- tem, called DeepER, that achieves good accuracy, high effi- ciency, as well as ease-of-use (i.e., much less human efforts). We use sophisticated composition methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a distributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to effectively capture similarities be- tween tuples. We consider both the case where pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are not; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations that are customized for a specific ER task under different scenarios. We propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking approach that takes all at- tributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks, compared with traditional methods that con- sider only a few attributes. We evaluate our algorithms on multiple datasets (including benchmarks, biomedical data, as well as multi-lingual data) and the extensive experimental results show that DeepER outperforms existing solutions.

    abstract: >
      The primary goal of this tutorial is for attendees to learn about recent work applying NLP to spoken and written conversations, with a focus on computational models for three related topics: conversational structure, summarization and sentiment detection, and group dynamics. We provide examples of specific NLP tasks within those three areas, how they relate to one another, their applications, and how we evaluate task performance. We will begin by discussing motivations and applications of applying NLP methods to conversations, including downstream applications that could benefit. Attendees will hear about the challenges of working with noisy data, and examples of datasets of spoken and/or written conversations. The first part of the tutorial covers conversational structures, the basic building blocks for working with conversational data. Participants will learn about computational methods for uncovering thread and topic structures of a conversation, detecting dialogue acts and adjacency pairs, identifying participant roles (where relevant), and how to treat disfluencies. We will cover methods for both synchronous (e.g., meeting, phone) and asynchronous (e.g., forum, email) conversations. In the second part of the tutorial, we will focus on sentiment analysis and summarization. Attendees will learn about the related, overlapping tasks of detecting sentiment, subjectivity, and opinions. We will cover unsupervised and supervised approaches, as well as multimodal sentiment detection. Participants will learn about intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluation of sentiment analysis methods for conversations. For summarization, we will cover core topics, such as the notions of extractive vs. abstractive summarization, and summarization vs. compression. In particular, participants will learn about the limits of extractive summarization on noisy and opinion-filled conversation data. We will particularly emphasize the question of how to evaluate automatically generated summaries, including some of the controversial history surrounding automatic summarization metrics that are widely used. In the final part of the tutorial, participants will learn about the growing field of research that uses NLP and machine learning methods to model and predict group dynamics, including prediction of group performance and participant affect. Attendees will learn about the close relationship between these three areas of summarization, sentiment, and group dynamics, and why researchers in each one of those areas often end up being concerned with the other two topics as well. Finally, we will discuss promising current and future directions of applying NLP to conversations.

      Discourse processing is a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks to uncover linguistic structures from texts at several levels, which can support many text mining applications. This involves identifying the topic structure, the coherence structure, the coreference structure, and the conversation structure for conversational discourse. Taken together, these structures can inform text summarization, essay scoring, sentiment analysis, machine translation, information extraction, question answering, and thread recovery. The tutorial starts with an overview of basic concepts in discourse analysis – monologue vs. conversation, synchronous vs. asynchronous conversation, and key linguistic structures in discourse analysis. It then covers traditional machine learning methods along with the most recent works using deep learning, and compare their performances on benchmark datasets. For each discourse structure we describe, we show its applications in downstream text mining tasks.

      Transition-based top-down parsing with pointer networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in multiple parsing tasks, while having a linear time complexity. However, the decoder of these parsers has a sequential structure, which does not yield the most appropriate inductive bias for deriving tree structures. In this paper, we propose  hierarchical pointer network parsers, and apply them to dependency and discourse parsing tasks. Our results on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and setting a new state-of-the-art in both parsing tasks.

      Recently, neural approaches to coherence modeling have achieved state-of-the-art results in several evaluation tasks. However, we show that most of these models often fail on harder tasks with more realistic application scenarios. In particular, the existing models underperform on tasks that require the model to be sensitive to local contexts such as candidate ranking in conversational dialogue and in machine translation. In this paper, we propose a unified coherence model that incorporates sentence grammar, inter-sentence coherence relations, and global coherence patterns into a common neural framework. With extensive experiments on local and global discrimination tasks, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing models by a good margin, and establish a new state-of-the-art.

      The ongoing neural revolution in machine translation has made it easier to model larger contexts beyond the sentence-level, which can potentially help resolve some discourse-level ambiguities such as pronominal anaphora, thus enabling better translations. Unfortunately, even when the resulting improvements are seen as substantial by humans, they remain virtually unnoticed by traditional automatic evaluation measures like BLEU, as only a few words end up being affected. Thus, specialized evaluation measures are needed. With this aim in mind, we contribute an extensive, targeted dataset that can be used as a test suite for pronoun translation, covering multiple source languages and different pronoun errors drawn from real system translations, for English. We further propose an evaluation measure to differentiate good and bad pronoun translations. We also conduct a user study to report correlations with human judgments.

      Monitoring patients in ICU is a challenging and high-cost task. Hence, predicting the condition of patients during their ICU stay can help provide better acute care and plan the hospital's resources. There has been continuous progress in machine learning research for ICU management, and most of this work has focused on using time series signals recorded by ICU instruments. In our work, we show that adding clinical notes as another modality improves the performance of the model for three benchmark tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, modeling decompensation, and length of stay forecasting that play an important role in ICU management. While the time-series data is measured at regular intervals, doctor notes are charted at irregular times, making it challenging to model them together. We propose a method to model them jointly, achieving considerable improvement across benchmark tasks over baseline time-series model.

      Deep neural networks have achieved great success on the image captioning task. However, most of the existing models depend heavily on paired image-sentence datasets, which are very expensive to acquire in most real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scene graph based approach for unpaired image captioning. Our method merely requires an image set, a sentence corpus, an image scene graph generator, and a sentence scene graph generator. The sentence corpus is used to teach the decoder how to generate meaningful sentences from a scene graph. To further encourage the generated captions to be semantically consistent with the image, we employ adversarial learning to align the visual scene graph to the textual scene graph. Experimental results show that our proposed model can generate quite promising results without using any image-caption training pairs, outperforming existing methods by a wide margin.

      With the rapid growth of video data and the increasing demands of various applications such as intelligent video search and assistance toward visually-impaired people, video captioning task has received a lot of attention recently in computer vision and natural language processing fields. The state-of-the-art video captioning methods focus more on encoding the temporal information, while lack of effective ways to remove irrelevant temporal information and also neglecting the spatial details. However, the current RNN encoding module in single time order can be influenced by the irrelevant temporal information, especially the irrelevant temporal information is at the beginning of the encoding. In addition, neglecting spatial information will lead to the relationship confusion of the words and detailed loss. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel recurrent video encoding method and a novel visual spatial feature for the video captioning task. The recurrent encoding module encodes the video twice with the predicted key frame to avoid the irrelevant temporal information often occurring at the beginning and the end of a video. The novel spatial features represent the spatial information in different regions of a video and enrich the details of a caption. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show superior performance of the proposed method.

      We propose an efficient neural framework for sentence-level discourse analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Our framework comprises a discourse segmenter to identify the elementary discourse units (EDU) in a text, and a discourse parser that constructs a discourse tree in a top-down fashion. Both the segmenter and the parser are based on Pointer Networks and operate in linear time. Our segmenter yields an F1 score of 95.4, and our parser achieves an F1 score of 81.7 on the aggregated labeled (relation) metric, surpassing previous approaches by a good margin and approaching human agreement on both tasks (98.3 and 83.0 F1)

      Claim verification is generally a task of verifying the veracity of a given claim, which is critical to many downstream applications. It is cumbersome and inefficient for human fact-checkers to find consistent evidences, from which solid verdict could be inferred against the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical attention network focusing on learning to represent coherent evidences as well as their semantic relatedness with the claim. Our model consists of three main components: 1) A coherence-based attention layer embeds coherent evidences considering the claim and sentences from relevant articles; 2) An entailment-based attention layer attends on sentences that can semantically infer the claim on top of the first attention; and 3) An output layer predicts the verdict based on the the embedded evidences. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms a set of state-of-the-art baselines.

      Discourse processing is a suite of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks to uncover linguistic structures from texts at several levels, which can support many downstream applications. This involves identifying the topic structure, the coherence structure, the coreference structure, and the conversation structure for conversational discourse. Taken together, these structures can inform text summarization, machine translation, essay scoring, sentiment analysis,  information extraction, question answering, and thread recovery. The tutorial starts with an overview of basic concepts in discourse analysis - monologue vs. conversation, synchronous vs. asynchronous conversation, and key linguistic structures in discourse analysis. We also give an overview of linguistic structures and corresponding discourse analysis tasks that discourse researchers are generally interested in, as well as key applications on which these discourse structures have an impact.

      Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning bilingual dictionary without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language pairs. In this work, we revisit adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. Extensive experimentations with European and non-European languages show that our method achieves better performance than recently proposed adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive with the supervised system.

      We address the problem of speech act recognition (SAR) in asynchronous conversations (e.g., forums, emails). However, unlike synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings, phone), asynchronous domains lack large labeled datasets to train an effective SAR model. In this paper, we propose methods to effectively leverage abundant unlabeled conversational data and the available labeled data from synchronous domains. We carry out our research in three main steps. First, we introduce a neural architecture based on hierarchical LSTMs and conditional random fields (CRF) for SAR in asynchronous conversations, and show that our method outperforms existing methods when trained on in-domain data only. Second, we improve our initial SAR models by semi-supervised learning in the form of pretrained word embeddings learned from a large unlabeled conversational corpus. Finally, we employ adversarial training to improve the results further by leveraging the labeled data from synchronous domains and by explicitly modeling the shift in two domains.

      Sufficient physical activity and restful sleep play a major role in the prevention and cure of many chronic conditions. Being able to proactively screen and monitor such chronic conditions would be a big step forward for overall health. The rapid increase in the popularity of wearable devices provides a significant new source, making it possible to track the user’s lifestyle real-time. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning technique called activ- ity2vec that learns and “summarizes” the discrete-valued ac- tivity time-series. It learns the representations with three com- ponents: (i) the co-occurrence and magnitude of the activity levels in a time-segment, (ii) neighboring context of the time- segment, and (iii) promoting subject-invariance with adver- sarial training. We evaluate our method on four disorder pre- diction tasks using linear classifiers. Empirical evaluation and analysis demonstrate that our proposed method performs bet- ter than many strong baselines, and adversarial learning helps improve the generalizability of our representations by pro- moting subject invariant features. We also show that using the representations at the level of a day works the best since human activity is structured in terms of daily routines.

      We present the Factorial Deep Markov Model (FDMM) for representation learning of speech. The FDMM learns disentangled, interpretable and lower dimensional latent representations from speech without supervision. We use a static and dynamic latent variable to exploit the fact that information in a speech signal evolves at different time scales. Latent representations learned by the FDMM outperform a baseline ivector system on speaker verification and dialect identification while also reducing the error rate of a phone recognition system in a domain mismatch scenario.

      Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14 English-German task. It also yields improvements over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.

      We propose a novel constituency parsing model that casts the parsing problem into a series of pointing tasks. Specifically, our model estimates the likelihood of a span being a legitimate tree constituent via the pointing score corresponding to the boundary words of the span. Our parsing model supports efficient top-down decoding and our learning objective is able to enforce structural consistency without resorting to the expensive CKY inference. The experiments on the standard English Penn Treebank parsing task show that our method achieves 92.78 F1 without using pre-trained models, which is higher than all the existing methods with similar time complexity. Using pre-trained BERT, our model achieves 95.48 F1, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art while being faster. Our approach also establishes new state-of-the-art in Basque and Swedish in the SPMRL shared tasks on multilingual constituency parsing.

      Conversational machine reading aims to teach machines to interact with users and answer their questions. It is challenging because machines have to understand the knowledge base text, evaluate and keep track of the user scenario, ask clarification questions, and then make a final decision. Existing approaches have implicit rule text reasoning processes for decision making and weak abilities for question-related rule extraction. In this paper, we present a new framework of conversational machine reading with a novel Explicit Memory Tracker (EMT) that explicitly tracks whether conditions listed in the rule text have already been satisfied to make a decision. Moreover, our framework generates clarifying questions by adopting a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, utilizing sentence-level selection scores to weight token-level distributions. On the ShARC benchmark (blind, held-out test set), EMT achieves new state-of-the-art results of 74.8% micro-averaged decision accuracy and 46.0 BLEU4. We also show that EMT is more interpretable by visualizing the entailment-oriented reasoning process as the conversation flows. Code and models will be released to facilitate research along this line.

      Recently, neural methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for many languages without the need for manually crafted features. However, these models still require manually annotated training data, which is not available for many languages. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cross-lingual NER model that can transfer knowledge from one language to another in a completely unsupervised way without relying on any bilingual dictionary or parallel data. Our model achieves this through end-to-end parameter sharing and adapting to the target domain through fine-tuning. Experiments on four different languages demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing models by a good margin and setting a new SOTA for each language pair.

      Cross-lingual word embeddings learned from monolingual embeddings have a crucial role in many downstream tasks, ranging from machine translation to transfer learning. Adversarial training has shown impressive success in learning cross-lingual embeddings and the associated word translation task without any parallel data by mapping monolingual embeddings to a shared space. However, recent work has shown superior performance for non-adversarial methods in more challenging language pairs. In this article,  we investigate adversarial autoencoder for unsupervised word translation and propose two novel extensions to it that yield more stable training and improved results. Our method includes regularization terms to enforce cycle consistency and input reconstruction, and puts the target encoders as an adversary against the corresponding discriminator. We use two types of refinement procedures sequentially after obtaining the trained encoders and mappings from the adversarial training, namely, refinement with Procrustes solution and refinement with symmetric re-weighting. Extensive experimentations with European, non-European and low-resource languages from two different datasets show that our method achieves better performance than existing adversarial and non-adversarial approaches and is also competitive with the supervised system. Along with performing comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components of our adversarial model, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the refinement procedures to understand their effects.

      Rumors spread in social media severely jeopardize the credibility of online content. Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose to learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we firstly represent the diffusion of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how a claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that 1) our RvNN-based models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than state-of-the-art approaches; 2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential posts can further improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and 3) our approach possesses superior capacity on detecting rumors at very early stage.

      Recent unsupervised machine translation (UMT) systems usually employ three main principles: initialization, language modeling and iterative back-translation, though they may apply these principles differently. This work introduces another component to this framework: Multi-Agent Cross-translated Diversification (MACD). The method trains multiple UMT agents and then translates monolingual data back and forth using non-duplicative agents to acquire synthetic parallel data for supervised MT. MACD is applicable to all previous UMT approaches. In our experiments, the technique boosts the performance for some commonly used UMT methods by 1.5-2.0 BLEU. In particular, in WMT'14 English-French, WMT'16 German-English and English-Romanian, MACD outperforms cross-lingual masked language model pretraining by 2.3, 2.2 and 1.6 BLEU, respectively. It also yields 1.5-3.3 BLEU improvements in IWSLT English-French and English-German translation tasks. Through extensive experimental analyses, we show that MACD is effective because it embraces data diversity while other similar variants do not.

      Data Diversification: An Elegant Strategy For Neural Machine Translation

      A common approach to improve neural machine translation is to invent new architectures. However, the research process of designing and refining such new models is often exhausting. Another approach is to resort to huge extra monolingual data to conduct semi-supervised training, like back-translation. But extra monolingual data is not always available, especially for low resource languages. In this paper, we propose to diversify the available training data by using multiple forward and backward peer models to augment the original training dataset. Our method does not require extra data like back-translation, nor additional computations and parameters like using pretrained models. Our data diversification method achieves state-of-the-art BLEU score of 30.7 in the WMT'14 English-German task. It also consistently and substantially improves translation quality in 8 other translation tasks: 4 IWSLT tasks (English-German and English-French) and 4 low-resource translation tasks (English-Nepali and English-Sinhala).

      Submodularity is a desirable property for a variety of objectives in content selection where the current neural encoder-decoder framework is deficient. We propose diminishing attentions, a class of novel attention mechanisms that exploit the properties of submodular functions. The resulting attention module offers an architecturally simple yet empirically effective method to improve the coverage of neural text generation. We run on three directed text generation tasks with different levels of recovering rate, across two modalities, three neural model architectures and two training strategy variations. The results and analyses demonstrate that our method generalizes well across these settings, produces texts of good quality, outperforms comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      Morphological inflection is a process of word formation where base words are modified to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, person, or number. World Englishes, such as Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) and African American Vernacular English (AAVE), differ from Standard English dialects in inflection use. Although comprehension by human readers is usually unimpaired by non-standard inflection use, NLP systems are not so robust. We introduce a new Base-Inflection Encoding of English text that is achieved by combining linguistic and statistical techniques. Fine-tuning pre-trained NLP models for downstream tasks under this novel encoding achieves robustness to non-standard inflection use while maintaining performance on Standard English examples. Models using this encoding also generalize better to non-standard dialects without explicit training. We suggest metrics to evaluate tokenizers and extensive model-independent analyses demonstrate the efficacy of the encoding when used together with data-driven subword tokenizers.

      Despite increasing instances of machine translation (MT) systems including contextual information, the evidence for translation quality improvement is sparse, especially for discourse phenomena. Popular metrics like BLEU are not expressive or sensitive enough to capture quality improvements or drops that are minor in size but significant in perception. We introduce the first of their kind MT benchmark datasets that aim to track and hail improvements across four main discourse phenomena: anaphora, lexical consistency, coherence and readability, and discourse connective translation. We also introduce evaluation methods for these tasks, and evaluate several baseline MT systems on the curated datasets. Surprisingly, we find that existing context-aware models do not improve discourse-related translations consistently across languages and phenomena.

      Most of the successful and predominant methods for bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) are mapping-based, where a linear mapping function is learned with the assumption that the word embedding spaces of different languages exhibit similar geometric structures (i.e., approximately isomorphic). However, several recent studies have criticized this simplified assumption showing that it does not hold in general even for closely related languages. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised method to learn cross-lingual word embeddings for BLI. Our model is independent of the isomorphic assumption and uses nonlinear mapping in the latent space of two independently trained auto-encoders. Through extensive experiments on fifteen (15) different language pairs (in both directions) comprising resource-rich and low-resource languages from two different datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models by a good margin. Ablation studies show the importance of different model components and the necessity of non-linear mapping.

      Visual dialog is a challenging vision-language task, where a dialog agent needs to answer a series of questions through reasoning on the image content and dialog history. Prior work has mostly focused on various attention mechanisms to model such intricate interactions. By contrast, in this work, we propose VD-BERT, a simple yet effective framework of unified vision-dialog Transformer that leverages the pretrained BERT language models for Visual Dialog tasks. The model is unified in that (1) it captures all the interactions between the image and the multi-turn dialog using a single-stream Transformer encoder, and (2) it supports both answer ranking and answer generation seamlessly through the same architecture. More crucially, we adapt BERT for the effective fusion of vision and dialog contents via visually grounded training. Without the need of pretraining on external vision-language data, our model yields new state of the art, achieving the top position in both single-model and ensemble settings (74.54 and 75.35 NDCG scores) on the visual dialog leaderboard.

      Transfer learning has yielded state-of-the-art results in many supervised natural language processing tasks. However, annotated data for every target task in every target language is rare, especially for low-resource languages. In this work, we propose MultiMix, a novel data augmentation method for semi-supervised learning in zero-shot transfer learning scenarios. In particular, MultiMix targets to solve cross-lingual adaptation problems from a source (language) distribution to an unknown target (language) distribution assuming it has no training labels in the target language task. In its heart, MultiMix performs simultaneous self-training with data augmentation and unsupervised sample selection. To show its effectiveness, we have performed extensive experiments on zero-shot transfers for cross-lingual named entity recognition (XNER) and natural language inference (XNLI). Our experiments show sizeable improvements in both tasks outperforming the baselines by a good margin.

      Although coherence modeling has come a long way in developing novel models, their evaluation on downstream applications has largely been neglected. With the advancements made by neural approaches in applications such as machine translation, text summarization and dialogue systems, the need for standard coherence evaluation is now more crucial than ever. In this paper, we propose to benchmark coherence models on a number of synthetic and downstream tasks. In particular, we evaluate well-known traditional and neural coherence models on sentence ordering tasks, and also on three downstream applications including coherence evaluation for machine translation, summarization and next utterance prediction. We also show model produced rankings for pre-trained language model outputs as another use-case. Our results demonstrate a weak correlation between the model performances in the synthetic tasks and the downstream applications, motivating alternate evaluation methods for coherence models. This work has led us to create a leaderboard to foster further research in coherence modeling.
